# Kimberlee Johnson's personal website 👩🏻‍💻
I used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a React framework, to get my website up and running quickly. 

## Make a site like this one 💻
* Fork and clone this repo, install dependencies, then cd into the directory and start it up with `gatsby develop`
* Head over to Gatsby's site and check out their list of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).

## Other resources 🌟
* Gatsby's step-by-step [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and docs are awesome. 
* I've also bookmarked this really great looking [Gatsby tutorial](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/up-and-running-with-gatsby-intro). There's so much more I want to learn and do with Gatsby!
