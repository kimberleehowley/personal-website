After I partnered with [Chloe Condon](https://twitter.com/ChloeCondon) on a project to celebrate [Mean Girls Day](https://dev.to/twilio/trying-to-make-fetch-errr-a-post-request-happen-12ad) last year, Chloe nominated me to be a [Twilio Champion](https://www.twilio.com/champions). 

The program sounded like so much fun, getting to collaborate with a community of developers, share learnings through blog posts, and sport some Twilio swag.

I didn't think I'd actually be accepted, so when Twilio reached out I was surprised and thrilled. And the surprises didn't stop. After I built [a few more projects](https://dev.to/kimberleejohnson), they asked to feature me in some photos and videos at their [Signal](https://signal.twilio.com/) conference. After the photoshoot, the city, state, and country all shut down because of COVID-19, and Signal pivoted to a virtual conference in the fall instead of an in-person one in May.

Especially during this time, when we're all stuck inside, I am so grateful for digital developer communities. The Champions program has been such an important one to me, and you can read my and other developers' thoughts about why over on [Twilio's blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/meet-our-heroes-twilio-champions). If you're a developer interested in getting involved with the program, please shout! I'd love to help.
