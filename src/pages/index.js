    Hi there! I'm a former PR person turned software engineer in-training. 
    When I'm not studying and writing about Lambda School, you can find me 
    practicing mandolin, running half marathons, and checking out books from 
    every library in San Francisco.
    </p>

    <p> This page, like me, is a work in progress! Thanks for visiting. </p>
