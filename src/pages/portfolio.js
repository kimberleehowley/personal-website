        During the COVID-19 crisis, a friend who runs a restaurant wanted to
        reach more takeout customers during Shelter in Place, but refused to
        work with delivery apps. I scraped The San Francisco Chronicleâ€™s
        Restaurant project, deployed it to a REST API using Node.js, and then
        connected that API to Twilio, setting up a phone number that could
        receive a zip code from a text message, look up the corresponding open
        restaurants, and respond to the sender with that list. Hundreds of
        people texted the number within 48 hours.
