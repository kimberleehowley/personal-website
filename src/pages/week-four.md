## Lambda School #4 
### I learned how to select and manipulate elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) in order to add events, event listeners, and components that combine both in a repeatable way via data attributes. 

Full disclosure: I only read up through the fifth Harry Potter book. That’s because when it came out in the summer of 2003, it wasn’t a question of if my dad would deploy to Iraq, but when. If you know what happens in the fifth book, you’ll get why I put the series down.

Besides, that’s still more than enough books for me to get most of the memes, or to know what a Lamba School instructor implied this week when he said something during lecture like, “When muggles work with developers…” 

<things I don’t post in the Slack questions thread> 

I got an email when I was accepted to Lambda School. Was it supposed to be an :owl:? 

</things I don’t post in the Slack questions thread> 

My dad enlisted in the Marines straight out of high school, because he saw it as his only way out of rural Utah. He may not have the context that I have about Hannah Arendt or others in the canon of a liberal arts education, but he’s still one of the first people I go to when I need someone to point something out to me that I know I’m not smart enough to see, not unlike how I turn to my group lead when I know I’m not spotting a typo in my code. 

I have absolutely no doubt that my dad would have made an excellent software developer. I wish that Lambda School had been an option when he retired from the Marines over a decade ago; I’m very glad it’s available today to the veterans I meet in my cohort. 

That’s why comments like the one the instructor made, and another later about “technical vs. non-technical people” irk me. I signed up for Lambda School because I believe any muggle can do this work. I’m hopeful about Lambda School because in theory it democratizes access to the opportunity. But until we question and reject the false narrative that developers are born a certain way, look a certain way, [like certain things](https://twitter.com/kimeejohnson/status/1116815245635280896), fewer people like me and my dad will take the leap, or stick with it once they get here. Every day I work with fellow students who in previous lives were healthcare providers or Amazon warehouse workers or limo drivers or bartenders. The list goes on. When they’re able to code circles around me, they’re always willing to pause to help me catch up. We mudbloods are in this together. 

Especially this week, when we were all introduced to a new, first-time instructor during week 4/4 of HTML, CSS, and Javascript basics. 

We covered the Document Object Model (DOM), an API that represents HTML and CSS content to the browser. Since it’s just a representation, not the content itself, we learned how to use the DOM to manipulate elements on a website, like changing the title of a news headline as a joke. After the joking, we turned to more serious things like how to get a website to do something when a user clicks on part of it: how to add events and event listeners to website elements. Finally, we learned how to automate those additions with reusable components and data attributes. 

Next week we’ll build a project covering all that we’ve learned so far in our first “Build Week.” I can’t wait. 

// How I’ll apply what I learned to this website 
- I’ll play around with adding an event and event listener to the image on my home page. 

// Advice for future/prospective Lambda students 
- Consider whether you want an education from a for-profit company. I should have thought more critically about how Lambda’s venture capitalist relationships might impact both decisions and how quickly they implement those sometimes disruptive changes. I still think Lambda School was the right choice for me given where I am in life, and I’ve had a positive overall experience, but I could have and should have braced myself better. 
- The more hours you can get practicing debugging in advance, the better! I wasted an hour looking for three missing letters this week, and I know the only thing that will make that easier is practice. Get the reps, in any language, in now if you can. 

// Life outside of Lambda 
- I watched and loved Brie Larson’s [Unicorn Store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_51UsTDBAE).
- I read the earliest germ of what I think is the real thing I want to write about, families changed by March 20, 2003, in my fiction class. Everyone was warm and supportive. I’m grateful for this safe space. 
- I went to free poetry at Grace Cathedral for the second time. I adore this space and it’s one of the many that makes San Francisco so special. 
- Am reading: This Ronald Reagan High School graduate finally read [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117496.What_Does_Joan_Say_?ac=1&from_search=true) by Nancy Reagan’s astrologist. Why it wasn’t required reading for me in high school I don’t know. I spent Friday night finishing Toni Morrison’s tiny gorgeous [God Help the Child](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23602473-god-help-the-child), and am moving onto [Sharp](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36624415-sharp), about ten quick-witted women starting with one of my patron saints Dorothy Parker, because they all had opinions and so do I.
