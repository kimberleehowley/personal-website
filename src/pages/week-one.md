title: Getting to know git and HTML and CSS, too (Lambda School #1)
date: "2019-03-23"

##H2 I learned how and why to use semantic HTML and CSS flexbox, what the box model means for website styling, and how to use git to save my projects and Github to store them remotely.

  A former MIT president once likened getting an education at MIT to [taking a drink from a fire hose] (https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/drinking-from-a-firehose/). I did not go to or even apply to MIT. But a high school boyfriend was obsessed with getting in, and quoted folklore like this to me constantly. When MIT mailed me and thousands of other students who scored above a certain SAT score fat recruiting pamphlets he told me, “I can’t imagine why they’d be reaching out to you.” 
	Fast forward a decade and I’m at my laptop at 8am sharp on a Monday, reviewing Lambda School prep material on HTML and CSS, programming languages web developers use to build content and styling, respectively, on websites. In lecture we cover what it means to give meaning to HTML tags, or to make our code “semantic,” and when we move on to CSS specificity, how certain styling attributes cascade down elements of a web page, I think about how I’d explain the concept using a map of the Mean Girls cafeteria. 
I’m still working on it. But, before I have time to go back to North Shore I’m applying what we learned in lecture in a [Codepen project] (https://codepen.io/kimberlee/pen/KEBdOy), restyling a bakery website. It feels approachable, and all eight students in my small study cohort feel good when we regroup at the end of the day. 
  We continue with CSS the next day, learning about the box model and how to manipulate an element’s space on a web page, and we cover the attribute display: inline-block to get those elements to display in a row. But, this time, by the end of the day none of us feels great about the website we had to restyle using those tools. We hop off our daily standup and I head to the library, where I get kicked out at 10pm, [after finishing at 9:56] (https://codepen.io/kimberlee/pen/jJvBaa?editors=1100).  
Learning the CSS flexbox module the next day, and how it adds a whole bunch of helpful styling properties to elements like defaulting them to display in a row, almost feels cruel. I’m nervous enough from the night before to raise my hand to guinea pig pair programming for the next project. I meet A, who is the second veteran I’ve worked with at Lambda School, which makes this military brat glad again she chose this particular bootcamp. His five cats skitter back and forth across the head of his chair as we bounce around about the differences between justify-content: space-around vs. space-between to solve [this challenge] (https://github.com/kimberleejohnson/UI-III-Flexbox). Working together feels satisfying and immediately collaborative in a way few of my other work experiences have. 
	Confidence somewhat restored, Thursday we cover git, a track changes tool for developers, and how to push projects to Github. I [introduced myself] (https://github.com/kimberleejohnson/Lambda-Hello) to fellow Lambda students to practice the school’s unique git + Github flow, but ’m still trying to come up with a Good Place + Github crossover joke about forks and forking. 
  We take our first test on Friday, a three hour challenge to build a multipage website from mockups, using all we’ve learned. 
  I passed [this week] (https://github.com/kimberleejohnson/Sprint-Challenge--User-Interface), but I expect there to be a week when I’m held back and have to repeat. The Lambda School team has been so good about making that likely possibility judgment free. This is especially important when I imagine I am not the only student who has faced judgment and condescension in the past, both externally and worse internally. I know it’s not MIT, but after going from basic HTML to pushing a multipage website to Github in one week, I can’t help but liken Lambda school to a firehose as well, though I’m grateful I’m not paying tuition upfront for this one. 

// How I’ll apply what I learned to this website 
- I'll sort out some local repository issues I'm having. 
- I’ll add some CSS animations to my nav bar.  

// Learnings for future Lambda students 
- Get access to your training kit as soon as possible. Some technical difficulties kept me out of mine for a day, and I felt behind. 
- Don’t be afraid to pair program! I was intimidated to do it, but it wound up being the best thing I did all week. 
- Play around with Github in advance of Lambda School. The [Hello World] (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide is great. I’d also recommend getting familiar with [Codepen] (https://codepen.io/. 

// Life outside of Lambda 
- I’m slowly but surely training for the San Francisco half marathon. It feels good to be back on the road after 3.5 years. 
- My intro to writing fiction class at CCSF is still a delight. This week my group gave constructive feedback to one student’s experimental piece and another’s allegory. 
- Am reading: and am obsessed with [The audacity of Inez Burns] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36675567-the-audacity-of-inez-burns?ac=1&from_search=true). In my spare time, I'm writing a musical about her life.   
- I walked out of a musical at intermission for the first time. We went home to watch [Into the Spiderverse] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg52up16eq0) instead and that was one of the best decisions I made all week, second only to pair programming. 
- I made it out to the [Bayview Opera House] (http://bvoh.org/) to see [The Hate U Give] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw). It’s as good as everyone says, and something I personally needed to shut up and listen to.
